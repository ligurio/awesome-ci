### Introduction

There are a lot of cloud [continuous
integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) services. All
of them have a different set of functionalities, some of them require payment, some
of them are free.  I have created a list of such
services to make easy comparison of them and choose a more suitable one for you.

Some of the CI services have open source code thus you can set them up in standalone
mode. Pay attention to the column "Features".

There is a
[similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_continuous_integration_software)
comparison on Wikipedia.
